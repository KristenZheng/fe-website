      <strong>2.3&nbsp;Binding Arbitration:&nbsp;</strong>

    <p
      class="content"
    >If We cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 2 (or agree to arbitration in writing with respect to an Excluded Dispute) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, LAW, STATUTE, RULE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT&nbsp;INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT OR NEGLIGENCE, COMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, RESPONDENT SUPERIOR, AGENCY AND/OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY), WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. THIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT, SERVICE OR ADVERTISING CONNECTED TO THE PROVISION OR USE OF THE SERVICES. The Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;), not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all Disputes regarding this Agreement (and any Additional Terms) and the Services, including the &ldquo;No Class Action Matters&rdquo; Section below. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY. Electra Power Bank and You agree, however, that State or federal law shall apply to, and govern, as appropriate, any and all claims or causes of action, remedies, and damages arising from a Dispute regarding this Agreement and the Services, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to State&rsquo;s choice of law principles.</p>

      <strong>2.4&nbsp;Applicability of JAMS Rules and Location of Arbitration&nbsp;:&nbsp;</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      A Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;) using JAMS&rsquo; streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that You and an officer or legal representative of Electra Power Bank consent to in writing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the &ldquo;metropolitan statistical area&rdquo; (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where You are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and Electra Power Bank will pay the administrative and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Electra Power Bank to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 2 to be enforceable, then Electra Power Bank will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply and be bound by this Agreement and any Additional Terms, and will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including arbitrability. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement or the Services. You can obtain JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: JAMS:&nbsp;1.800.352.5267and&nbsp;

    <p
      class="content"
    >The Arbitrator will render a written decision within the time frame specified in the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be&nbsp;entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. The Arbitrator&rsquo;s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. The prevailing party in the arbitration shall be entitled to an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs, as long as the Arbitrator includes such an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in the written decision.</p>

      class="content"
    >YOU AND ELECTRA POWER BANK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 2 to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein (described in this &ldquo;No Class Action Matters&rdquo; section), are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.</p>
